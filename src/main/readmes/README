JTcl - Tcl Language Interpreter in Java

http://jtcl.kenai.com

JTcl is an implementation of Tcl (Tool Command Language) written in Java.
JTcl implements a large extent of Tcl 8.4 syntax and commands, limited 
only by API restrictions of the Java Virtual Machine.  JTcl is based on 
the Jacl interpreter (http://tcljava.sf.net)


INSTALLING JTCL

JTcl requires a Java JVM 1.5 or higher (Java 1.6 is recommended).  You may 
have to install Java if you don't already have it installed.  

JTcl is distributed as a ZIP archive.  Download the latest jtcl-{version}.zip 
file from the JTcl website, and unzip into a directory of your choice.  
Unix/Linux/Mac OSX shell script (`jtcl') and Windows batch file (`jtcl.bat') 
are included.   


SOURCE CODE

JTcl uses the Mercurial distributed source code control system.  Install
Mercurial using your OS distribution package manager or get executables
